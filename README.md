#### Front-End Developer at CONUN
I am a junior front-end developer. I use React.js.
I am well versed in React hooks. I'm handy with Redux, too.

Aside from JavaScript, I'm also a capable Python developer. For backend stuff, I recently picked up FastAPI, and it's a very straightforward library!
Check out my projects. My favourite one is Auto-Worksheet, but I'm also very fond of Flashmachine.
